**When to use**: When designing or revisiting the system architecture at the start of a new feature or module.
**When not to use**: When implementation details are already locked or when performing small fixes — use “Adjust Existing Code” or “Refactor” instead.

Let’s plan the architecture using the Architecture Loop Template.
Define components, data flows, and dependencies clearly before coding begins.
Map the architecture to the PRD and identify where testing coverage will be necessary.
Pause to validate assumptions and confirm the architectural design before implementation.
Before writing or generating architecture files, ask me questions to clarify the system design and component structure.
When you get confirmation to write the architecture document, write the result to `/docs/foundation/architecture.md`.
**Architecture Loop Template reference**: /prompts/system/00_b_architecture_loop.md

PRD is located inside /docs/foundation folder.
