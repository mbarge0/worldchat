**When to use**: When beginning the first working session of a new phase after initialization has been completed.
**When not to use**: When transitioning between tasks inside a phase or revisiting partially complete work — use “Continue Build” or “Adjust Existing Code” instead.

Let’s kick off this phase by reviewing the objectives and verifying the required context.
Use the Planning Loop Template to outline tasks, dependencies, and expected outcomes before coding.
Summarize how this phase connects to prior progress and highlight any key risks or open questions.
Pause for confirmation before proceeding into implementation.
