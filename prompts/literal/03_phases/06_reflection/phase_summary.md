**When to use**: When a development phase has just been completed and you want to summarize outcomes and key learnings.
**When not to use**: When work is still ongoing or results are incomplete — use “Midpoint Status Check” instead.

Please summarize the work completed in this phase using the Reflection Loop Template.
Include what was built, what challenges were encountered, how they were resolved, and the outcomes achieved.
Conclude with next-step recommendations for the next phase.
