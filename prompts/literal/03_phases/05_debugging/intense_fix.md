**When to use**: When a major functionality issue or system-level bug requires a broad repair or partial rewrite.
**When not to use**: When a small change will resolve the issue — use “Surgical Fix” instead.

Let’s perform an intensive fix using the Debugging Loop Template.
Diagnose the root cause of the issue, describe its impact, and propose an approach before implementing.
Document changes clearly and test rigorously after each segment of code adjustment.
Pause for confirmation before final integration.
