**When to use**: When continuing a build session where code or tasks from this phase remain incomplete.
**When not to use**: When starting a completely new feature or system — use “Begin Build” instead.

Let’s continue development using the Build Loop Template.
Retrieve and summarize the last completed steps from this phase.
Confirm all dependencies remain valid, then resume implementation from the last successful checkpoint.
Pause to verify assumptions or environmental conditions before proceeding.
