> Note: Foundry Core v2 prefers super-phase prompts in `/prompts/literal/02_superphases/` (Plan/Build/Reflect). This file remains available as a granular option.

**When to use**: Starting development for a new feature or system at the beginning of a fresh phase.
**When not to use**: When you’re already mid-build or making targeted edits to existing code — use “Continue Build” or “Adjust Existing Code” instead.

Let’s begin implementing this phase using the Build Loop Template.
Reference the task plan for this phase, and follow the structure in the template.
Include a concise outline of the implementation plan first, then start writing code step by step.
Verify each key part works before moving to the next.
Pause before full execution to confirm your interpretation if any assumption is unclear.
