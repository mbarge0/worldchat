**When to use**: When preparing to transition work to another phase, developer, or system environment.
**When not to use**: When still iterating on code or testing actively — use “Reflection” instead.

Let’s prepare the phase handoff using the Handoff Loop Template.
Summarize the project state, ensure documentation and tests are complete, and verify deployment readiness.
List all relevant resources and instructions for smooth transition to the next stage.
