**When to use**: When verifying or clarifying the PRD and functional requirements before implementation.
**When not to use**: When requirements are already finalized and the team is ready to build — use “Begin Build” instead.

Let’s perform a complete review of the requirements for this phase using the Planning Loop Template.
Clarify objectives, confirm inputs, and list assumptions that need validation.
Document dependencies and ensure all tasks are mapped to acceptance criteria.
Pause to confirm alignment before moving forward.
