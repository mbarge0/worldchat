# UI Review System Prompt

Use this during the **UI Review Phase** ‚Äî typically right after Build and before Testing ‚Äî  
to ensure the implemented interface is visually and behaviorally aligned with the approved design  
and conforms to your global UI guidelines.

---

## Prompt Template

We are now performing a **UI Review** for this phase.

Please:

1. Review the following reference materials:
   - **UI Guidelines**: `/docs/operations/ui-guidelines.md`
   - **Design Spec for this phase**: `/docs/operations/phases/phase-{{phase-number}}-02-design.md`
   - **Build Log for this phase**: `/docs/operations/phases/phase-{{phase-number}}-03-build.md`
2. Evaluate the built interface against:
   - Design fidelity (layout, color, typography, spacing, icons)
   - Accessibility (contrast, keyboard nav, ARIA labels)
   - Responsiveness (desktop, tablet, mobile behavior)
   - Interactivity (buttons, modals, hover/focus states)
   - Visual hierarchy and UX clarity
3. Summarize findings in a structured checklist:
   - **Compliant:** ‚úÖ items that meet design and guideline standards
   - **Issues:** ‚ö†Ô∏è items that deviate or are missing
   - **Recommendations:** üéØ actionable next steps for improvement
4. Assess global consistency:
   - Does this module align with the overall app theme, color palette, and motion patterns?
   - Are reusable components consistent (buttons, modals, input fields, etc.)?
5. Conclude with:
   - A confidence score (0‚Äì100%) for visual compliance
   - Priority fixes before QA or deployment
   - Notes for future design iteration if required

## Guidance Notes

- **Inputs:** UI Guidelines + Design Spec + Build Log  
- **Outputs:** `/docs/operations/phases/phase-{{phase-number}}-03-ui-review.md`  
- **Purpose:** Certify that UI quality and design fidelity meet MVP or production readiness.  
- **Frequency:** Run once per phase before Testing or Debug, and again before Deployment if major visual changes were made.  
- **Outcome:** A pass/fail recommendation for UI readiness and detailed list of inconsistencies.

## Output Format

Output Storage
Store the resulting report under /docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-XX-01-plan.md (or the relevant file for Build or Reflect).
New work always goes into /docs/operations/phases/recent/.
When a phase is completed or superseded, move the entire set of related artifacts from /recent/ to /archive/.
If the current supermodule or module does not have a number, assign it the next available phase number from the Development Checklist.

If multiple system prompts (like Start, Plan, and Design) are run for the same super phase, they should all append to the same file.
Each should begin with a labeled heading (e.g., ## Start, ## Plan, ## Design, ## Build, etc.).
The combined file serves as the complete report for that super phase.

It should also contain the following sections:

1. **Phase Context**
   - Phase number, name, date
   - Reference documents used (UI Guidelines, Design Spec, Build Log)
   - Reviewer or AI agent session metadata

2. **Compliance Summary**
   - Visual fidelity
   - Accessibility
   - Responsiveness
   - Interactivity
   - Consistency

3. **Detailed Checklist**
   - Table of ‚úÖ Compliant, ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues, üéØ Recommendations

4. **Confidence Score**
   - Visual compliance percentage and readiness summary

5. **Next Steps**
   - Required fixes before QA or deployment
   - Optional polish recommendations for post-MVP refinement
