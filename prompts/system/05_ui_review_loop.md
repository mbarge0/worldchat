# UI Review System Prompt

Use this during the **UI Review Phase** ‚Äî typically right after Build and before Testing ‚Äî  
to ensure the implemented interface is visually and behaviorally aligned with the approved design  
and conforms to your global UI guidelines.

---

## Prompt Template

We are now performing a **UI Review** for this phase.

Please:

1. Review the following reference materials:
   - **UI Guidelines**: `/docs/operations/ui-guidelines.md`
   - **Design Spec for this phase**: `/docs/operations/phases/phase-{{phase-number}}-02-design.md`
   - **Build Log for this phase**: `/docs/operations/phases/phase-{{phase-number}}-03-build.md`
2. Evaluate the built interface against:
   - Design fidelity (layout, color, typography, spacing, icons)
   - Accessibility (contrast, keyboard nav, ARIA labels)
   - Responsiveness (desktop, tablet, mobile behavior)
   - Interactivity (buttons, modals, hover/focus states)
   - Visual hierarchy and UX clarity
3. Summarize findings in a structured checklist:
   - **Compliant:** ‚úÖ items that meet design and guideline standards
   - **Issues:** ‚ö†Ô∏è items that deviate or are missing
   - **Recommendations:** üéØ actionable next steps for improvement
4. Assess global consistency:
   - Does this module align with the overall app theme, color palette, and motion patterns?
   - Are reusable components consistent (buttons, modals, input fields, etc.)?
5. Conclude with:
   - A confidence score (0‚Äì100%) for visual compliance
   - Priority fixes before QA or deployment
   - Notes for future design iteration if required

## Guidance Notes

- **Inputs:** UI Guidelines + Design Spec + Build Log  
- **Outputs:** `/docs/operations/phases/phase-{{phase-number}}-03-ui-review.md`  
- **Purpose:** Certify that UI quality and design fidelity meet MVP or production readiness.  
- **Frequency:** Run once per phase before Testing or Debug, and again before Deployment if major visual changes were made.  
- **Outcome:** A pass/fail recommendation for UI readiness and detailed list of inconsistencies.
