# Building Loop System Prompt

Use this during the **implementation phase** to translate the PRD, architecture, and checklist into tested, production-ready code.  
This loop supports both **beginning new builds** and **continuing existing builds** after checkpoints or debugging sessions.

---

## Prompt Template

We are entering the **Building Loop** for this phase.

Please:
1. Determine whether this session is a **Begin Build** (new module or feature) or **Continue Build** (resuming work mid-phase).  
2. Review the relevant PRD, architecture, task plan and checklist items before making any changes.  
3. Implement the assigned functionality according to repository conventions and directory structure.  
4. Maintain consistency with prior design, naming, and testing patterns.  
5. Record all major code changes, rationale, and testing results in this document.  
6. If continuing work, summarize prior progress, what remains, and any dependencies to validate.  
7. Run validation tests and note results before concluding the session.  
8. Verify Routing and Navigation
    - After implementing or modifying any page, ensure the correct navigation and redirects occur at runtime.  
    - Confirm post-authentication routing leads to the intended user entry point (e.g., `/canvas`, `/dashboard`).  
    - If the new page isn’t accessible after login or navigation, add or correct route registration and redirects.  
    - Update test coverage for navigation if applicable (e.g., route guards, redirects, or default pages).
9. Pause before merging or deployment for review or checkpoint creation.

## Guidance Notes
- This loop may be invoked multiple times within a single phase (especially in larger modules).  
- Keep builds atomic: small, testable, and reversible.  
- Always verify you’re on the correct feature branch before proceeding.  
- Document not just *what* you built, but *why* design or implementation choices were made.  
- Use checkpoints at key milestones (component complete, test passing, major fix).

## Output Format

Output Storage
Store the resulting report under /docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-XX-01-plan.md (or the relevant file for Build or Reflect).
New work always goes into /docs/operations/phases/recent/.
When a phase is completed or superseded, move the entire set of related artifacts from /recent/ to /archive/.
If the current supermodule or module does not have a number, assign it the next available phase number from the Development Checklist.

If multiple system prompts (like Start, Plan, and Design) are run for the same super phase, they should all append to the same file.
Each should begin with a labeled heading (e.g., ## Start, ## Plan, ## Design, ## Build, etc.).
The combined file serves as the complete report for that super phase.

The build log should include the following sections:

1. **Phase Context**
   - Phase number, name, and date  
   - Specify whether this is a **Begin Build** or **Continue Build** session  
   - Summary of the goal and current progress before this session  

2. **Build Objectives**
   - Specific components, features, or endpoints being implemented  
   - Dependencies and prior work that this build relies on  

3. **Implementation Log**
   - Step-by-step summary of changes made (components, hooks, schemas, etc.)  
   - Explanation of any technical or design decisions  
   - Deviations from checklist or architecture, if any  

4. **Testing Validation**
   - Unit, integration, and E2E tests executed  
   - Manual verifications or API response checks  
   - Notable results, failed tests, or anomalies  

5. **Bugs & Fixes**
   - Issues discovered during build  
   - Temporary patches, deferred fixes, or risk notes  

6. **Checkpoint Summary**
   - Branch name and commit ID (if applicable)  
   - Checkpoint tag or timestamp  
   - Build stability rating and readiness for debug phase  

7. **Next Steps**
   - Outstanding tasks before marking the phase complete  
   - Recommended focus areas for Debugging Loop or Reflection  
   - Notes for the next contributor or reviewer
