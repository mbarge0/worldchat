# Week 1 Close-Out Reflection — Collab Canvas & Foundry Core V2

**Date:** {{today’s date}}

---

## 1️⃣ What Worked Well
- **Foundry Core V2 Stability:** Verified clean builds, automated motion system, and debug pipeline moved out of Build.
- **Collab Canvas Execution:** Met Gauntlet early-submission standards and passed the rubric.
- **System Prompts & Docs:** Unified under the super-phase model (Plan → Build → Reflect).  
- **Visual Verification:** Reliable headless runs and evidence archiving validated the test loop.

---

## 2️⃣ Where I Hit Friction
- Initial interruptions from verification during builds.  
  *Resolved by moving Evolvr + Visual into the Debug phase.*
- Early repo confusion between Foundry Core and Collab Canvas; later unified through the Git + Cursor workflow.
- Motion and Showcase integrations required a clean separation of “framework-level” (Foundry Core) vs. “app-level” (Collab Canvas).

---

## 3️⃣ How Foundry V2 Improved My Workflow
- **Lifecycle Commands:** `plan`, `build`, `debug`, `launch` create a predictable rhythm.  
- **Docs Hierarchy:** `/recent` → `/archive` flow keeps artifacts organized.  
- **Motion System:** Introduced a reusable layer for animation polish.  
- **Debug Phase:** Consolidated behavioral, visual, and motion verification under one command.  

---

## 4️⃣ Key Learnings for Week 2
- Maintain separation of *retrieval logic (back end)* and *UX polish (front end)*.
- Chunking, caching, and latency management will matter once RAG services appear.
- Use Foundry’s motion system to enhance perceived speed in mobile UIs.

---

## 5️⃣ Next Steps
- Produce the professional showcase video for Collab Canvas.  
- Archive Week 1 evidence and tag the repo as `week1-final`.  
- Branch into `week2-prep` for RAG Systems & Data Pipelines.  

**Overall Status:** ✅ Week 1 complete — ready for Week 2.
