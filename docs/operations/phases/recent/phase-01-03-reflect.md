## Reflection

### Phase Context
- Phase: 01 — Supermodule 1: Setup & Auth
- Date: 2025-10-20
- Duration: ~1–1.5 days (active build + tests)
- Objectives: Auth service, onboarding, profile, rules, tests; align with checklist Modules 1.1–1.4

### Achievements
- Implemented `services/auth/authService.ts` (signUp/signIn/signOut, displayName set)
- Implemented `services/auth/userProfileService.ts` (create/update, timestamp)
- Hardened `firestore.rules` (self-only users; participants-only conversations/messages; read-only translation cache)
- Unit tests added and passing (4/4): auth + profile services
- Build/UI Review/Debug reports authored with clear next actions

### Challenges
- Initial unit test run failed due to a non-test file; resolved via vitest exclude
- Firestore emulator tests blocked by missing Java runtime locally
- No device E2E yet; pending manual validation on iOS/Android

### Root Cause Analysis
- Test failure: repository included a “test” file without a suite; exclusion rule fixed it
- Emulator failure: environmental prerequisite (Java) not installed; documented remedy and commands

### Process Evaluation
- Code aligns with plan and repo conventions; small, readable modules
- Testing improved with quick unit scaffolding; emulator coverage pending
- Documentation kept up-to-date (plan, build, regression checklist)

### Phase Performance Score
- 85% — Core code delivered, rules tightened, unit tests pass; emulator + device E2E outstanding

### Key Learnings
- Add/maintain a tests directory structure early to prevent stray files breaking runs
- Environment prerequisites (Java) should be captured in a dependency checklist up front
- Keeping design/UI tokens referenced from a single doc simplifies UI review

### Actionable Improvements
- Add CI step to run unit tests and (optionally) emulator tests when Java is present
- Create a minimal device E2E script/checklist for auth flows
- Add README section for emulator setup (Java + commands)

### Forward Outlook
- Next supermodule (Messaging Core) depends on stable auth/session and rules; proceed once emulator + device E2E pass
- Social login and password reset remain deferred

### Reflection Summary
Setup & Auth was implemented cleanly with hardened rules and passing unit tests. Remaining work is environmental (Java) and device E2E; once complete, the foundation will be stable for Messaging Core.

## Handoff

### Phase Summary
- Phase Name: Supermodule 1 — Setup & Auth
- Date Completed: 2025-10-20 (code + unit tests), emulator/device validation pending
- Duration: ~1–1.5 days
- Phase Outcome: Auth + profile services implemented; rules tightened; unit tests passing; docs prepared
- Stability Rating: Medium-High (emulator/device validation outstanding)

### Core Deliverables
- Services
  - `services/auth/authService.ts`
  - `services/auth/userProfileService.ts`
- Security
  - `firestore.rules` (hardened)
- Tests
  - `services/auth/__tests__/authService.test.ts`
  - `services/auth/__tests__/userProfileService.test.ts`
  - `tests/firestore/rules.test.ts` (emulator-based)
- Docs
  - Plan: `docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-01-01-plan.md`
  - Build/UI Review/Debug: `docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-01-02-build.md`
  - Regression checklist: `docs/operations/regression/phase-01-regression-checklist.md`
  - UI Guidelines: `docs/operations/ui-guidelines.md`

### Testing Status
- Unit: 4/4 passing
- Rules: tests scaffolded; pending emulator (Java runtime)
- E2E: pending device validation for sign-up → language setup → profile → restart persistence → logout/login

### Risks and Limitations
- Emulator not runnable without Java; device E2E pending
- No social auth/reset flows (deferred)

### Next Objectives
- Install Java; run rules tests:
  - `pnpm exec firebase emulators:exec --only firestore --project worldchat-test "pnpm -s test"`
- Manual E2E on devices for full auth/onboarding flow
- Proceed to Supermodule 2 (Messaging Core) once above is green

- Tech Stack: `/docs/foundation/tech_stack.md`
- Regression Manifest: `/docs/operations/regression/00_master_regression_manifest.md`
- Branch: `feature/supermodule-1`

### Summary Statement
Auth and onboarding groundwork is complete with solid rules and unit coverage. After emulator and device validations, the project is ready to enter Messaging Core with a stable identity layer.
